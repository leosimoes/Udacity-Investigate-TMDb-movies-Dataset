# Investigate a TMDb movies Dataset

Project 2 of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Program.

Analysis of movies information.


## Dataset

The dataset can be found in the [`tmdb-movies.csv`](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/October/59dd1c4c_tmdb-movies/tmdb-movies.csv) file extracted from Kaggle.


## Summary of Findings

The questions were analyzed only for the period from 2010 to 2015:

- For that period, the genre present in the largest number of films was Drama, followed by Comedy and Thriller. 
- Still for this period, the most popular film genre was Adventure, followed by Science Fiction and Western. 
- Despite its popularity, Adventure is less than a third the number of Drama films. 
- Drama features half the popularity of the Adventure genre.
- The most popular films seem to have the most votes. 
- The greater number of votes does not imply that the votes will be of high grade. 
- The popularity, even though it is high, does not imply that the votes are of a certain value.
